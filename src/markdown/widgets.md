# For backers and sponsors

To show the list of collectives that you are backing on your website, just add this script:

    <script src="https://opencollective.com/:username/widget.js"></script>

E.g. http://polycode.co.uk

# For collectives

## Donate button

    <script src="https://opencollective.com/:collectiveSlug/donate/button.js" color="[white|blue]"></script>

Just replace `:collectiveSlug` with the slug of your collective (e.g. webpack for https://opencollective.com/webpack).
Example:
<center><script src="https://opencollective.com/webpack/donate/button.js"></script><script src="https://opencollective.com/webpack/donate/button.js" color="blue"></iframe></center>


## Show backers and sponsors

Just add this script:

    <script src="https://opencollective.com/:collectiveSlug/banner.js"></script>

where `:collectiveSlug` is the slug of your collective, e.g. `apex` for https://opencollective.com/apex.

### Examples:
- http://apex.run/#links

### How to customize it?

This will use the default styling of your `h1` and `h2` on your page.
You can target them with CSS to customize them:

    #opencollective-banner h1 {
      color: black;
    }
